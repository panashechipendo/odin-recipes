    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This is homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: Half a pound of ground pork, hal a pound of ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong>: Diced onion.</li>
        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: A can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Herbs</strong>: Two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: A dash of Sugar</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong>: Uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong>: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong>: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
