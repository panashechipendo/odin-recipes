    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        This is homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong>: Uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
